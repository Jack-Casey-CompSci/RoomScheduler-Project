# RoomScheduler-Project
Designed a room scheduler GUI application using Java, derby databases, and SQL to help faculty members manage rooms for a building on campus.
In this project, Faculty members can do the following:
  1) make a reveration for a room based on the date and number of seats available for the room
  2) cancel a prior reservation based on the date and availabilty.
  3) add or drop a room from the application and put in available dates that rooms are available for.
  4) check the status of a faculty member to see what rooms and dates the faculty member has reserved and/or is waitlisted for.
  5) check the status of the waitlist to see what faculty members are waiting for rooms.
overall this was a fun project that helped build up my knowledge on backend and frontend development.
